            <h2>The Drama Within (Turquoise Troubles) featuring Holding Onto You (Commentary)</h2>

             <p>holding onto you started as literally two sentences from a random blurb of thoughts i had written down two years about not wanting to leave a toxic friendship. <br /> 
                 "when all you do is stir shit and lie for the hell of it, why am i still holding onto our friendship. why do i still hold onto you?"<br />
                 <br />
                 upon the revisiting of the feelings through writing this album, i returned to these two lines, and got inspired to write something about the feeling.<br />
                 and i love the antithesis between the original track and my track, the idea of someone running away when things get serious, and in my version, staying even when things turn for the worst. <br />
                 <br />
                 i feel like this is more a personal insecurity track, which is why i left this and a few other tracks i had written off 'the drama within'. but there's a certain affinity i feel towards this song that i needed to share this song.<br />
                 the hurt inside having to leave is the only that kept me there, but sometimes the staying is worse than the leaving.<br />
                 i promise at some point the songs i have left behind will be yours to hear (i have about an album's worth of unreleased songs that i want to eventually share from this era). but for now, i hope you enjoy this one.<br />

             <p>Twenty nineteen, many moons ago<br />
                And we all were still friends with you<br />
                Midnight, in your bedroom<br />
                You dream of both me and you<br />
                Stuck up on a ferris wheel, <br />
                And you’re the giving me a service<br />
                In your bed, you've reached the finish line first<br />
                Told me, next day, now i’m disturbed<br />
                A story that should be kept to yourself<br />
                Especially when we we’re both 13<br />
                Diaries exist for a reason,<br />
                just keep it to yourself<br />
                Fucking hell now I know<br />
                That you had a crush on me<br />
                Apparently so bad<br />
                You couldn’t contain the feeling<br />
                And if I was in your place<br />
                You couldn’t waterboard it out from me<br />
                And then there’s this caravan<br />
                A dream involving my two other guy friends<br />
                Really cold winter, this story was set in<br />
                And only one way to heat the building<br />
                'Till us all of us walked in, at the point of quaking<br />
                The bed is soaked, yes that’s what you’re saying<br />
                Don’t forget one of these boys was a mormon<br />
                And the other you treated like your younger brother<br />
                Don’t you think we’d be uncomfortable<br />
                Hearing your brain’s escapades<br />
                Fucking hell now I know<br />
                That you had a crush on all the boys<br />
                Apparently so bad<br />
                You couldn’t contain the feeling<br />
                And if I was in your place<br />
                You couldn’t waterboard it out from me<br />
                Half asleep, dazed away<br />
                High in the sky, but for us, this is scary<br />
                Please don’t say you're in love with me<br />
                But you're going to<br />
                Remember we’ve been friends<br />
                Since we were little, and what you’ve said<br />
                this has changed how I perceive us as friends<br />
                Maybe we shouldn’t be<br />
                Friends, and this is kind of weird<br />
                You were just so graphic about it<br />
                And if I was in your place<br />
                You couldn’t waterboard it out from me</p>

            <p>I can't believe it, my fifth ola album "The Drama Within" is out now!!!</p>
            <button class="read-more-btn" onclick="toggleContent('content4')">Read More</button>
            <div id="content4" class="extra-content">
                <p>Such an exciting release for me, this has been months in the making and I'm so excited to be sharing it with you today!</p>
                <p>The creation process has been insane for album, I have written over 30 songs for this! Only 10 songs made the cut, and this time even added my intro, as a spoken word at the start.</p>
                <p>This album delves into a complicated history of my high school years, and as you guessed it, the drama that ensued during those years. 
                This isn't only just about one person. Hell no, several people are the subjects of the stories that I detail throughout this album. 
                You never know what people are capable of doing until they do it to you.</p>
                <p>I hope you enjoy it as much as I did making it, but now this chapter of my life is closed, and is now yours. Lots of love, Lachie</p>
